# Eat My Shorts

Cross-platform malware development library for anti-reversing techniques

## Introduction

Looking to frustrate analysts and advanced EDR capabilities from understanding your malware implant?

## Goals

* Build a rich interface for defense evasion for Golang, a popular choice for red teams and malware devs.
    * Cross-platform and static compilation support!
* Utilize defensive software development to make reverse engineering difficult
    * Reduce use of functions / `call`s, maximize inlining assembly
* Use as a learning resource for both attack and mitigation, and a collaborative project to contribute 
new techniques
