# The Anti-Analysis Menagerie

Cross-platform malware development library for anti-analysis techniques.

## Design Goals

* Provide a rich and convenient interface for defensive evasion for Golang, a popular choice for red teams and malware engineers.
* Incorporate "defensive software development" (ie. minimizing `call`s, confusing control flow) to make reverse engineering even more difficult
* Use as a learning resource for both attack and mitigation, and a collaborative project to contribute new techniques

## Techniques Supported

* Anti-Debugging

* Anti-Virtualization

* Anti-Disassembly
